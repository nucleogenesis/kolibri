      And there is a <lesson> with a <resource> and <exercise> assigned to <class>

    Scenario: Review lesson reports
      When I click on lesson <lesson>

        And I see the *Progress* and *Average time spent* columns for each resource

          And I see columns with <learner> progress and time spent on each exercise or resource in the <lesson>
        When I click on <exercise> exercise
        Then I see the attempt report of the <learner> for each question in the <exercise>
