Import VM image into VirtualBox
-------------------------------

Extract the contents of downloaded **.zip** file to obtain the corresponding VM image file with **.ova** extension.

Double-click the **.ova** file to import the VM into VirtualBox. You can change some options in the Import window, but itâ€™s best if you leave the default values and setup everything in the VirtualBox **Settings** once VM is already imported.
