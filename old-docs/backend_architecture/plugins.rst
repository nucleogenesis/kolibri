Kolibri plugin architecture
============================

The behavior of Kolibri can be extended using plugins. The following is a guide
to developing plugins.

Enabling and disabling plugins
------------------------------

Non-core plugins can be enabled or disabled using the ``kolibri plugin`` commands.

.. automodule:: kolibri.plugins.registry

.. automodule:: kolibri.plugins.hooks

Defining a plugin
-----------------

A plugin must have a Python module inside it called ``kolibri_plugin``, inside this there must be an object subclassed
from ``KolibriPluginBase`` - here is a minimal example:

.. code-block:: python

    from kolibri.plugins import KolibriPluginBase

    class ExamplePlugin(KolibriPluginBase):
        pass

The Python module that contains this ``kolibri_plugin`` module can now be enabled and disabled as a plugin.
If the module path for the plugin is ``kolibri.plugins.example_plugin`` then it could be enabled by:

.. code-block:: bash

    kolibri plugin enable kolibri.plugins.example_plugin

The above command can be passed multiple plugin names to enable at once.
If Kolibri is running, it needs to be restarted for the change to take effect.

Similarly, to disable the plugin the following command can be used:

.. code-block:: bash

    kolibri plugin disable kolibri.plugins.example_plugin

To exactly set the currently enabled plugins (disabling all other plugins, and enabling the ones specified) you can do this:

.. code-block:: bash

    kolibri plugin apply kolibri.plugins.learn kolibri.plugins.default_theme

This will disable all other plugins and only enable ``kolibri.plugins.learn`` and `kolibri.plugins.default_theme``.

Creating a plugin
-----------------

Plugins can be standalone Django apps in their own right, meaning they can define templates, models, new urls, and
views just like any other app. Any activated plugin is added to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting of Django, so any models,
templates, or templatetags defined in the conventional way for Django inside an app will work inside of a Kolibri plugin.

In addition, Kolibri exposes some additional functionality that allows for the core URLs, Django settings, and Kolibri
options to be extended by a plugin. These are set

.. code-block:: python

    class ExamplePlugin(KolibriPluginBase):
        untranslated_view_urls = "api_urls"
        translated_view_urls = "urls"
        options = "options"
        settings = "settings"

These are all path references to modules within the plugin itself, so options would be accessible on the Python module path
as ``kolibri.plugins.example_plugin.options``.

``untranslated_view_urls``, ``translated_view_urls`` should both be standard Django urls modules in the plugin that expose
a ``urlpatterns`` variable - the first will be mounted as API urls - with no language prefixing, the second will be mounted
with language prefixing and will be assumed to contain language specific content.

``settings`` should be a module containing Django settings that should be added to the Kolibri settings. This should not be
used to override existing settings (and an error will be thrown if it is used in this way), but rather as a way for plugins
to add additional settings to the Django settings. This is particularly useful when a plugin is being used to wrap a Django
library that requires its own settings to define its behaviour - this module can be used to add these extra settings in a
way that is encapsulated to the plugin.

``options`` should be a module that exposes a variable ``options_spec`` which defines Kolibri options specific to this plugin.
For more information on how to configure these, see the base Kolibri options specification in *kolibri/utils/options.py*.
These values can then be set either by environment variables or by editing the ``options.ini`` file in the ``KOLIBRI_HOME``
directory. These options values can also be used inside the settings module above, to provide customization of plugin specific
behaviour. These options cannot clash with existing Kolibri options defined in ``kolibri.utils.options``, except in order to
change the default value of a Kolibri option - attempting to change any other value of a core Kolibri option will result
in a Runtime Error.

A very common use case for plugins is to implement a single page app or other Kolibri module for adding frontend functionality
using Kolibri Javascript code. Each of these Javascript bundles are defined in the `kolibri_plugin.py` file by subclassing the
``WebpackBundleHook`` class to define each frontend Kolibri module. This allows a webpack built Javascript bundle to be
cross-referenced and loaded into Kolibri. For more information on developing frontend code
for Kolibri please see :doc:`/frontend_architecture/index`.
